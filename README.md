**Disclaimer**:
If I didn't specifically tell you to clone this repo, there is no reason for you to linger here.

## Setup
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install
    gulp

## After you get that working
Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
Then try your best at the examples through editing the non-spoiler files in the `www/` directory. You chould check out `index.html`, `styles/style.scss` and `scripts/awsm.js`.

**PS**: Don't touch the `.css` files.
